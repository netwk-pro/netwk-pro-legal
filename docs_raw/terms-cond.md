## 3. Disclaimer of Warranties

All services are provided "as is" and "as available" without
warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or
otherwise. The Company expressly disclaims all implied warranties,

specifically agreed in writing.

## 4. Assumption of Risk

Client acknowledges that cybersecurity and privacy-related
services inherently involve risk. The Company does not guarantee
uninterrupted service, error-free implementation, or complete
immunity from breaches or attacks. Client assumes full
responsibility for decisions based on our recommendations and
agrees to maintain appropriate internal controls and backup
protocols.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company shall not be
liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or
punitive damages, including without limitation loss of profits,
data, business interruption, or reputational harm, arising from or
related to the use or performance of the services, even if advised
of the possibility of such damages. Direct damages, if any, shall
be limited to the amount paid by Client for the specific services
giving rise to the claim.

<a name="6-indemnification"></a>

## 6. Indemnification

Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
Company, its officers, employees, contractors, and affiliates from
and against any claims, damages, liabilities, losses, and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to (i)
Client's misuse of the services, (ii) misconfiguration of systems
by Client, or (iii) third-party claims related to services
rendered under these Terms.

## 7. Client Responsibilities

**Client shall provide valid, secure, and licensed infrastructure,
access credentials, and third-party tools necessary for service
delivery.** The Company shall operate exclusively within
client-owned or designated environments and shall not
independently host, process, or store client data. Compliance with
any regulatory frameworks (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS) is the sole
responsibility of the Client unless explicitly agreed otherwise in
a separate written agreement.

courts located in Maricopa County, Arizona, and both parties
consent to such jurisdiction and venue.

## 10. Exceptions and Negotiations

obligations on the Company.
